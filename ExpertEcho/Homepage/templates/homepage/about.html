Why trust the experts?<br><br>

For any given position, there are going to be people who claim to be experts on both sides, so how do we determine who the actual
    experts are?<br><br>

The philosopher Alvin Goldman, in the article Which Experts Should You Trust? proffered the following criteria:
Experts often give arguments and evidence for their views, and I can then determine who is the most convincing. The problem is that
    laypeople are often not qualified to determine this. You would essentially have to become an expert yourself.
Indirect indicators - if person P1 makes arguments and person P2 cannot respond to them, but the same is not true in reverse, we may
    conclude that P1 is the expert and P2 is not. But this could be a problem because maybe both sides are just good at arguing/debating
    or one side just may not want to debate for one reason or another. So indirect indicators may be overly simplistic.
Agreement from other experts - this option just presupposes that some people are experts, but how do we identify them? This was the
    original problem in the first place.
Meta-experts - this is an independent assessment of experts’ expertise. Credentials are a standard method, such as degrees from reputable
    universities. A meta-expert can be an institution, it doesn’t have to be a person. This seems like the best criteria, provided the
    institution has a good track record of accomplishments. The consensus of experts in a particular field is even more robust
    than the beliefs of one particular expert.<br><br>

There is a potential problem regarding the idea of meta-experts; the regress problem. This deals with how we should identify who/what
    the meta-experts are.<br><br>

There are supposed to be various institutional features of science that detect & remove bias & deceit. Scientist’s work is subject to peer
    review, which means papers are only published when they’ve been extensively critiqued by others in the field. There are also extremely
    high costs associated with fraud in science, such as fabricating data. Any scientist who is found to have engaged in such misconduct
    risks losing their entire career. The cost of lies here is higher than in other fields. For example, when a politician lies there is
    often very little or no consequence at all. Making up data can also lead to criminal prosecution in some cases, such as in medical
    research. Furthermore, a way to gain credibility and fame in science is to falsify accepted hypotheses, so scientists are constantly
    looking for flaws (such as bias) in research. Thus, once a hypothesis has been accepted by a majority of scientists we can be fairly
    confident that it is genuinely well-supported by evidence and has been generally rid of bias.<br><br>

Track records can also be used to establish expert legitimacy. If two people say different things and on has a good track record of research
    and producing correct predictions, etc. and the other does not, this can be a good indication of the former's legitimacy and the
    questionable legitimacy of the latter.<br><br>

In a world that is increasingly complex and interconnected, informed decision-making is paramount. Expert consensus, derived from the
    collective knowledge and expertise of qualified professionals in various fields, provides a valuable foundation upon which individuals,
    policymakers, and societies can base their choices. The tendency even for laypeople to converge upon the correct position when their consensus
    is taken provides an even stronger argument that the consensus of experts in a particular field is highly reliable. That is the
    goal of this site; to aggregate the opinions of experts within their fields and allow the general public quick and easy access to it
    in various forms (polls, blogs, and debates).<br><br>

        This project began the way many do. I thought to myself “Wouldn’t it be nice if there was a website that was a one-stop
    shop for expert consensus on any and every topic?” Upon finding that no such site existed, coupled with the fact that I
    have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, I decided to create it myself. It’s currently a work in progress
    (I’m currently going back through my code and realizing I should have done many things different and more efficiently)
    but I hope that, one day, it may take on an important cultural role for curious laypeople, experts wishing to become more
    knowledgeable about related fields, or, my true end goal, creating a more well-informed general public and thus a more
    responsive political establishment that is better aligned with the desires and wellbeing of its citizens.<br><br>

    The site is based on the IGM Forum, which is a site that aggregates consensus from experts in the field of economics,
    but my site has loftier goals. I want to draw on expert knowledge not just in economics, but in law, medicine, political
    science, philosophy, and many other fields.<br><br>

    I enjoy reading books on philosophy, science, and politics in my spare time, and I have listed myself as an expert in
    philosophy, which is far from true. As I’ve said, this site is a work in progress and those currently on it are just
    showing off what the site would look like when it’s complete and has become more well-known. It’s merely a prototype
    at the moment, not an official source of information.<br><br>

    Features.

    This site will eventually allow any user to sign up for it, but only verified experts will be able to create content on it.
    Currently, anyone who signs up is able to follow a given expert, at which point they will be able to see notes
    (similar to Twitter posts) from these experts on their home page. These notes may contain anything from announcements about
    a new blog, debate, or poll the expert created or took part in, or they may contain links to other sites or merely a few
    thoughts the expert has on a given subject.<br><br>

    The content each user can create are blogs, debates, and polls. Blogs are fairly straightforward; they are simply essays of any
    length that a user may post. Debates are authored by a given user, with the category of the debate being set to the user’s
    academic field. The user then creates the topic of the debate, provides a basic description of it, and challenges another user
    on the site to the debate. If the other user accepts, each will be able to post a response to the other in turn
    (you may only post one response at a time, with turns alternating between the two people engaged in the debate). A user may also
    author a poll, and only users within that field may vote in the poll, and they may only vote once.<br><br>

    Each user who signs up may create a profile with a profile picture, a biography, and links to other sites of theirs. A user’s profile
    shows which other users they’re following and who follows them. The user may choose to follow or unfollow another user from their
    profile. You may also send a user a direct private message from their profile.<br><br>

    Where is the site going from here?<br><br>

    Over the next several months I will be continuously working on this website and adding a number of features to it. The first priority
    is restructuring the code so it is more efficient and cleaner. After this I plan on adding a notification system, a section which
    addresses current political candidates, tracks their policies, and subjects them to expert analysis, and perhaps even a section
    which allows public peer-review of various politically important and/or controversial opinions in an attempt to address the constant
    promotion of misinformation on the internet.<br><br>

    This website is written in Python using the Django framework.
